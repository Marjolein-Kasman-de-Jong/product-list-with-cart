# Product List With Cart

[Frontend Mentor Challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/product-list-with-cart-5MmqLVAp_d)

The challenge was to build out this product list project that includes a functional cart and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:
* Add items to the cart and remove them
* Increase/decrease the number of items in the cart
* See an order confirmation modal when they click "Confirm Order"
* Reset their selections when they click "Start New Order"
* Navigate the whole project and perform all actions using only their keyboard
* View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
* See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## Languages

* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Libraries

* React
